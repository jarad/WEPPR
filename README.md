# WEPPR

The [water erosion prediction project](https://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/tool/watershed-erosion-prediction-project-wepp)
(WEPP) is a physically-based soil erosion computer model 
supported by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  

This is an R package to read and write WEPP input-output files and run WEPP 
using the statistical software R. 
This should allow those who are familiar with R a more convenient interface for
running a large set of WEPP runs. 

## Development

Development uses the [WEPP documentation extensively](https://www.ars.usda.gov/midwest-area/west-lafayette-in/national-soil-erosion-research/docs/wepp/wepp-model-documentation/).
In particular, the 
[user summary document](https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/50201000/WEPP/usersum.pdf) provides a succinct summary.
