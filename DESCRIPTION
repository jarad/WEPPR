Description: The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) computer model
    simulates water erosion events and estimates runoff, soil detachment, and
    soil loss. This package intends to provide easy of access for R users to the
    WEPP model including reading and writing input and output files as well as
    running WEPP on Linux systems. The focus in development has been to read and
    write files associated with the Daily Erosion Project (DEP) and therefore some 
    idiosyncrasies associated with DEP are likely.
